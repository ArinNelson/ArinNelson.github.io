About Me

### More Information

I am an ocean scientist currently stationed in Rhode Island, developing a forecast system for the Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound.  It will include assimilating observations (to nudge the forecast model in the right direction) and biological variables to predict harmful ecological events leading to fish kills, beach closures, etc.

Most of my time outside of work consists of trying to keep up with my young daughter, but I occasionally have time for walks, tennis, gardening, tea, music, dog training, local history, and reading/writing about paranormal things.
